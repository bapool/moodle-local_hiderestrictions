HIDE RESTRICTIONS PLUGIN FOR MOODLE
====================================

Author: Brian A. Pool, National Trail Local Schools
Plugin Type: Local
Moodle Version: 4.5+
License: GPL v3


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This local plugin allows teachers to toggle the visibility of activity and 
resource restrictions on Moodle course pages. When enabled, teachers can hide 
the "Not available unless:" messages and restriction badges that appear on 
activities, making the course page less cluttered and easier to navigate while 
editing.

By default, restrictions are visible to all teachers. Each teacher can 
individually toggle the visibility on/off, and their preference is saved 
across all sessions.

The toggle button only appears in courses where completion tracking is enabled,
as restrictions are typically only used with completion tracking.


FEATURES
--------
* Floating toggle button visible on all course pages for easy access
* Only appears in courses with completion tracking enabled
* Individual user preferences - each teacher's choice is saved independently
* Works on both main course pages and within course sections
* Restrictions remain visible to students - only affects teacher view
* Restrictions remain visible in activity settings pages for editing
* Simple icon-based toggle with hover tooltips
* Default setting: restrictions visible (teachers can hide if desired)
* Also accessible via course "More" menu for alternative access


INSTALLATION
------------
1. Download and extract the plugin files

2. Upload to your Moodle installation:
   - Copy the 'hiderestrictions' folder to: moodle/local/

3. Ensure the language file is in the correct location:
   - Language file should be at: moodle/local/hiderestrictions/lang/en/local_hiderestrictions.php

4. Set proper file permissions (example for Ubuntu/Linux):
   chmod -R 755 /path/to/moodle/local/hiderestrictions
   chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/moodle/local/hiderestrictions

5. Log in to Moodle as an administrator

6. Navigate to: Site administration → Notifications

7. Moodle will detect the new plugin and prompt you to install it

8. Click "Upgrade Moodle database now"

9. Purge all caches: Site administration → Development → Purge all caches
   Or via CLI: php /path/to/moodle/admin/cli/purge_caches.php


USAGE
-----
1. Navigate to any course as a teacher or course creator

2. The course must have completion tracking enabled:
   - Go to Course settings → Completion tracking → Enable "Yes"

3. Look for the floating toggle button in the bottom-right corner of the page:
   - Eye-slash icon + "Restrictions" = restrictions are visible (click to hide)
   - Eye icon + "Restrictions" = restrictions are hidden (click to show)

4. Click the toggle to switch between showing and hiding restrictions

5. Your preference is automatically saved and will persist across sessions

6. The toggle is also available in the course "More" menu for alternative access

7. Note: Restrictions are always visible when editing activity settings,
   regardless of the toggle state


CONFIGURATION
-------------
No configuration is required. The plugin works immediately after installation.

To change the default behavior (show vs hide restrictions by default):
- Edit lib.php and toggle.php
- Change: get_user_preferences('local_hiderestrictions_hidden', 0)
- Use 0 for visible by default (current setting)
- Use 1 for hidden by default


REQUIREMENTS
------------
* Moodle 4.5 or higher
* PHP 8.0 or higher
* Teacher or course creator role with moodle/course:update capability
* Course must have completion tracking enabled for toggle to appear


COMPATIBILITY
-------------
* Tested with Moodle 4.5.7
* Compatible with Boost and Academi themes
* Should work with most standard Moodle themes
* Floating button positioned to avoid conflicts with page content


TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------
The plugin uses:
* CSS injection to hide restriction elements when toggled
* Page type detection to apply only to course view pages
* Completion tracking check - only displays in courses with completion enabled
* User preferences API to store individual teacher settings
* Navigation API to add the toggle button to course "More" menu
* Floating button with Font Awesome icons for easy access
* Session key verification for security

The plugin only affects the main course view pages (topics, weeks, single 
activity formats). It does NOT hide restrictions on:
* Activity and resource settings pages
* Module editing forms
* Other administrative pages

Hidden elements on course view include:
* Activity availability information
* "Not available unless" messages
* Restriction badges and icons
* Completion and access restriction details

Language strings:
All user-visible text is stored in language files for easy translation:
* Button text: "Restrictions"
* Tooltips: "Hide Restrictions" / "Show Restrictions"
* Location: lang/en/local_hiderestrictions.php


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If the toggle button doesn't appear:
1. Verify you have teacher/editing permissions in the course
2. Check that completion tracking is enabled in the course settings
3. Clear all Moodle caches (Web UI or CLI)
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
5. Ensure plugin files are in: moodle/local/hiderestrictions/

If restrictions don't hide when toggled:
1. Clear browser cache and reload the page
2. Purge all Moodle caches (Web UI or CLI)
3. Verify CSS is loading (check browser developer tools)

If restrictions are hidden in activity settings:
1. This should not occur in version 1.2+
2. Verify you have the latest version of lib.php
3. Purge all caches after updating

If button appears in courses without completion tracking:
1. Verify you have version 1.2+
2. Purge all caches after updating
